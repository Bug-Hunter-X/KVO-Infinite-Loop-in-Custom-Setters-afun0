In Objective-C, a subtle error can occur when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) with custom setters. If a custom setter modifies other properties that also trigger KVO, it might lead to unexpected behavior or infinite loops. For instance, if a change in 'propertyA' updates 'propertyB' and the observer for 'propertyB' also modifies 'propertyA', a cyclical dependency may arise resulting in continuous KVO notifications and potential crashes.  This is often missed during testing because the conditions for the infinite loop might not be triggered easily.
